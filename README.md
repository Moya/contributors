### Moya Contributors

##### Background

Moya started out as a project in Artsy under the ownership of [Ash Furrow](/ashfurrow) and [Orta Therox](/orta). Over time Moya became too big for us to maintain within the Artsy product cycle.

After watching [The Social Coding Contract](http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-12-02-the-social-coding-contract.html) we opted to find ways to make [the project](/Moya/Moya/issues/135) more welcoming to external contributors.

This document tries to clarify how we can include as many people as possible within the project.
